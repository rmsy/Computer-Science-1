Practice with text files

When it says to store data into a file on the disk, it means the hard drive or your jump drive, etc.

Save as Text19
==============
Ask the user for their name, address, and age. Store these into a
file named "text19.out" on the disk. The form should be:

Name    : Ben Barnes
Address : 1234 Main St.
Age     : 97



Save as Text20
==============
Ask the user for four integers. Compute the average of the integers
and store them into a file named "text20.out" on the disk. The form
should be:

Your numbers were:
125
67
93
82
The average = 91.750



Save as Text21
==============
Ask the user for two points: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Compute the
slope and save the data into a file named "text21.out" on the
disk. The form should be:

Point 1 : (-3, 4)
Point 2 : (5, -2)
Slope   : -0.7500



Save as Text22
==============
Each bus can hold 50 people. A bus must be full to be used.
Ask the user for the number of people wanting to go on a
road trip. Then save the data into a file named "text22.out"
on the disk. The form is:

Total people : 223           //Example 1
Busses used  : 4
People left  : 23


Total people : 350           //Example 2
Busses used  : 7
People left  : 0


Total people : 47            //Example 3
Busses used  : 0
People left  : 47



Save as Text23
==============
    Ask the user for two item names (String), the cost of each
of those items (double), and the number of each item they want.
Save output to a file named "text23.out" on the disk. Please
make the output look similar to:


Item               Price each      Quantity            Total
============================================================
      Plaid Coat       125.99             2           251.98
           Candy         0.85            11             9.35
                                      TOTAL           261.33
