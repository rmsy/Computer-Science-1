Practice with text files

When it says that a file is on the disk, it means the hard drive, your
jump drive, etc.


Save as Text6
=============
  This program will get information from a file named "text6.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

title
title
title
title

All of the titles are Strings. The information obtained should
print out in this form:

The titles were:
  "Illusions"
  "To Kill a Mockingbird"
  "Atlas Shrugged"
  "Along Came a Spider"

The double quotes (") should surround the titles. If you don't know how
to do this, just ask.


Save as Text7
=============
  This program will get information from a file named "text7.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

double
double
double
double

The information obtained should print out in this form:

   19.4500
  725.8000
    0.6810
  999.9999

Notice that all of the decimal points line up.



Save as Text8
=============
  This program will get information from a file named "text8.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

double
double
double
int

The first three numbers represent the sides of a triangle. The 
fourth number is an integer scale factor. Output should be 
in this form:

The original triangle sides were:
   2.870 
  11.900
  10.750

With a scale factor of 2, the new triangle sides are:
   5.740
  23.800
  21.500

Notice that the values have three decimal places and that the decimal
points line up.


Save as Text9
=============
  This program will get information from a file named "text9.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

String
String
String

Print the output in this form:

String 1 : Homer Simpson for president
String 2 : I love computers!
String 3 : Is it spring break yet?

String 1 has 27 characters
String 2 has 17 characters
String 3 has 23 characters

You can find how many characters are in a String by using
the length method for Strings. So if you have a String named
s1, you can count its characters by doing this:

x = s1.length();     //Here, x is an integer that was already declared


Save as Text10
==============
  This program will get information from a file named "text10.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

right
wrong

where right and wrong are both ints that represent how many questions
were answered correctly and how many were not. Assuming that the first
integer in the file was 20 and the second one was 12, the output should 
look like:

Correct : 20
Wrong   : 12
% Correct = 62.50%
