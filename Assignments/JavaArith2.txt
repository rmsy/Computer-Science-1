==================
Get a basketball player's name, the number of free throws attempted,
and the number of free throws made. Then calculate the free throw
average according to this formula:

                          # made
   Free throw average = ------------
                        # attempted

Output should look like this

Name : Wilda Shott
Free throws attempted = 76
Free throws made      = 29
Average               = 0.382


NOTE: the # attempted and # made must be ints...

==================
Get the number of questions on a test (int) and the number
the person got right (int). Print out the information
in this form:

There were 35 questions on the test
You answered 27 correctly
You missed 8
The percentage correct was 77.1%

==================
Ask the user for the measure of two interior angles of a 
triangle. Then show the output like this:

First angle = 28.6 degrees
Second angle = 100.9 degrees
Remaining angle = 50.5 degrees

==================
Ask the user for a number. Print a table of 5 squares and cubes,
beginning with the user's number. If the user chose 3, the table would
look like this:

Number          Square          Cube
====================================
     3               9            27
     4              16            64
     5              25           125
     6              36           216
     7              49           343

===================
A linear equation is in the form: AX + B = C. Ask the user for the values
for A, B, and C, then solve for X. Output should be in this form:
(NOTE: Assume that A will NOT be 0)

Your equation : 5X + 9 = 2
X = -1.4
