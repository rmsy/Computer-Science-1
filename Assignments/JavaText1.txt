Practice with text files

When it says that a file is on the disk, it means the hard drive, your
jump drive, etc.


Save as Text1
=============
  This program will get information from a file named "text1.dat"
on the disk. The information is stored in this form:

int
int
int
int

Read these four integers from the file and print them out in
a neat form.


Save as Text2
=============
  This program will get information from a file named "text2.dat"
on the disk. The information is stored in this form:

double
double
double
double
double

Read these five doubles from the file and print them out in this
form:

      2.3581
    175.0012
      0.6000
   1852.3000
     28.0500

Notice that the numbers should be printed with 4 decimal places no
matter how many decimal places the number has in the file. Also,
the decimal points should all line up.


Save as Text3
=============
  This program will get information from a file named "text3.dat"
on the disk. The information is stored in this form:

String
String
String

The Strings represent the names of cities. Print them out in a
neat, informative way.


Save as Text4
=============
  This program will get information from a file named "text4.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

name
address
age
school
gpa

name, address, and school are Strings; age is an int; gpa is a double.

The information obtained should print out in this form:

Name    : Lisa Simpson
Address : 1234 Subnormal Lane
Age     : 15
School  : I.M. Loco High School
GPA     : 3.9000

NOTE: Any time that you read in a number and THEN read in a String,
      you should use a line of code that looks like this before
      reading in the String.

      infile.nextLine();


Save as Text5
=============
  This program will get information from a file named "text5.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

test1
test2
test3
test4

All of the data are ints.

Calculate the average (double) of these 4 test scores. The
information obtained should print out in this form:

Tests   : 94 87 72 96
Average : 87.250
