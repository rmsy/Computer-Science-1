Practice with input and output

Here are some programs that will give you practice in performing input
and output. Please write these programs according to the specifications
shown. Make your output match the form of the examples as closely as
you can.


Remember, the first time you compile a new program, you are asked for the 
filename. The filename must match your program name. But change the folder
in which to save the program to your folder on the d: drive. If you have
trouble with this, let me know.

When you are done for the day, copy your programs (the files that end in 
".java") to your jump drive. Make sure you back your working files up.

================
Get the user's name, age, and the amount of their hourly wage. Assume
the wage will be less than 100 dollars per hour. Print the information
so that:

  1. The right side of each line is 20 characters from the left side
     of the screen.

  2. The hourly wage is shown with a dollar sign and 2 decimal places.

Example: if Donald Duck is 19 years old and makes 75 dollars per hour,
         the output would be:

         Donald Duck
                  19
              $75.00

Example: if Freddy Kruger is 193 years old and makes 2.98 per hour,
         the output would be:

       Freddy Kruger
                 193
              $ 2.98

================
Get the user's name, place of employment, age, and years on the job.
Print the information in EXACTLY the form shown below.

Example: if Al Bundy is 50 years old, has worked at The Shoe Palace
         for 28 years, the output would be:

Name : Al Bundy
Work : The Shoe Palace
Time : 28 years
Age  : 50

================
Get the user's name, gpa, rank, and the number of students
in their class. Print the information in EXACTLY the form shown
below.

Example: Ima Toobright has a gpa of 4.52 and is first in her class
         of 386; the output would be:

Ima Toobright, whose gpa = 4.5200, is #1 out of 386 students


Example: Willy Getout has a gpa of 0.997 and is 302 in his class
         of 305; the output would be:

Willy Getout, whose gpa = 0.9970, is #302 out of 305 students



Save as InOut9
================
Get three students' names and how many pages each read over the
summer. Print the information in EXACTLY the form shown below.
You can assume no student read more than one thousand pages and
that no name is more than 20 characters in length.

HINT: Think of the data as being printed out in three fields, 
      and set the field width for each...


                Student        Pages
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1.          Lottie Time          876
2.      "Biz" E. Always            4
3.          I.B. Normal          251



Save as InOut10
=================
Ask the user for a String. Print the String on four separate lines, 
indenting by five characters each time. The only things you can use
in your printf's are the String variable name and field with. You
cannot put any spaces in the printf's. For example, if my String is
"Man, this is weird", then the output would be:

Man, this is weird
     Man, this is weird
          Man, this is weird
               Man, this is weird
