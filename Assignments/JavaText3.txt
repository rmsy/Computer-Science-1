Practice with text files

When it says that a file is on the disk, it means the hard drive, your
jump drive, etc.


Save as Text11
==============
  This program will get information from a file named "text11.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

-4  7
2  -8

The file contains two integers per line; these integers represent
the coordiates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). You will be
computing the slope of the line between the two points. The
information obtained should print out in this form:

For points (-4, 7) and (2, -8) the slope is -2.5000



Save as Text12
==============
  This program will get information from a file named "text12.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

Simpson
Homer
J

The first two items are Strings and the third is a char. The
information obtained should print out in this form:

The name entered was : Simpson, Homer J.



Save as Text13
==============
  This program will get information from a file named "text13.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

4
8
3

Each of these items is an int and they represent the length,
width, and depth of a rectangular fish tank. The output should
look like:

A tank that is 4 X 8 X 3 has a volume of 96 cu. units



Save as Text14
==============
  This program will get information from a file named "text14.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

18.50
9.75
0.38
125.00
0.08

The first four items are doubles that represent the cost of 
four items in a store. The fifth item is a double that represents
the sales tax rate. The output should look like:

Your items cost:
                  18.50
                   9.75
                   0.38
                 125.00

tax               12.29  
=======================
Total            165.92

NOTE: you can assume no item will cost more than 999.99; also
      notice that the decimal points all line up



Save as Text15
==============
  This program will get information from a file named "text15.dat" on
the disk. The information is stored in this form:

100
0
54
81

These items all represent integer temperatures measured in Celsius
degrees. The output should be in this form:

100 degrees Celsius = 212.0 degrees Fahrenheit
0 degrees Celsius = 32.0 degrees Fahrenheit
54 degrees Celsius = 129.2 degrees Fahrenheit
81 degrees Celsius = 177.8 degrees Fahrenheit

                                      9
NOTE: The formula is:   Fahrenheit = ---(Celsius) + 32
                                      5
