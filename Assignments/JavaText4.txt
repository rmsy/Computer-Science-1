Practice with text files

When it says that a file is on the disk, it means the hard drive, your
jump drive, etc.

Save as Text16
==============
The file name should be "mileage.dat". The information is stored
in this form:

int (starting odometer reading)
int (the ending odometer reading)
int (number of gallons used)
double (price per gallon)
String (model of car)

Your program should print results in the following form:

For your 2010 Chevy truck:
  Ending mileage : 24524
Starting mileage : 23950
     Total miles : 574
    Gallons used : 25
           Price : $1.09

Miles per gallon : 22.96
      Total cost : $27.25

NOTE: remember that after reading in a number, you should use
      a line of code that looks like this before reading in a
      String.

      infile.nextLine();



Save as Text17
==============
The filename is "RightTriangle.dat", and the information is
stored in this form:

double (side a of a right triangle)
double (side b of a right triangle)

Your program should print output in this form:

For a right triangle, the sides are:
a =  13.750
b =   9.080
c =  16.478

Notice that the decimal points line up.

NOTE: if I want to find the square root of a number n1 and store
      it into a double named "answer", this is the code:

      answer = Math.sqrt(n1);

      We'll get to this "officially" pretty soon; but you need it
      now for this problem.
 


Save as Text18
==============
The filename is "distance.dat" and the data is stored in this
form:

int  (x of first point)
int  (y of first point)
int  (x of second point)
int  (y of second point)

Get the two points from the file, then print your output
in the following form: 

The distance between points (-3, 5) and (8, -2) = 13.0384
