Practice with Java methods

Directions:
===========
Each of these should have AT LEAST an input method
and an output method. Additional methods will be
noted if needed...


Save as Methods6
================
  Ask the user for four strings. In another method,
calculate how many of the user's strings are longer
than 10 characters. Print the results in the output method.


Save as Methods7
================
  Ask the user for two legs (doubles) of a right
triangle. Then print out all three sides. You'll be
computing the hypotenuse (a^2 + b2) in a separate method. Output
should look like:

Leg1       : 8.520
Leg2       : 10.700
Hypotenuse : 13.678


Save as Methods8
================
  Get three doubles from the user. In another
method, return which of the first two is the closest
to the third (whether higher or lower). Output should
be like:

You entered : 7.50 5.10 6.31 
7.50 is closer to 6.31

Let's assume that the first two parameters should be
non-equal values


Save as Methods9
================
  Get a String from the user. In another method,
calculate and return a String that is the uppercased
version of the user's String. In yet another method
return a String that is the lowercased version of the
user's String. Output should look like:

Original : "Homer Simpson loves 13 donuts, Hmmmm..."
Upcased  : "HOMER SIMPSON LOVES 13 DONUTS, HMMMM..."
Lowcased : "homer simpson loves 13 donuts, hmmmm..."

You can't use the toUpperCase or toLowerCase methods.


Save as Methods10
=================
  Ask the user for two doubles that represent the
length and width of a rectangle. In other methods,
calculate the area and diagonal of the rectangle.
Output should look like:

Length   : 4.7000 
Width    : 12.1500
Area     : 57.1050
Diagonal : 13.0274
