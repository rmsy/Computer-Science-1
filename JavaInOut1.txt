Practice with input and output

Here are some programs that will give you practice in performing input
and output. Please write these programs according to the specifications
shown. Make your output match the form of the examples as closely as
you can.


Remember, the first time you compile a new program, you are asked for the 
filename. The filename must match your program name. But change the folder
in which to save the program to your folder on the d: drive. If you have
trouble with this, let me know.

When you are done for the day, copy your programs (the files that end in 
".java") to your jump drive. Make sure you back your working files up.



save as InOut1
================
  Print YOUR intials on the screen. For instance, if your name is Freddy
  Krueger, your output would look like:

  FFFFFFF   K     K
  F         K   K
  FFFF      K K
  F         K  K
  F         K   K
  F         K     K   



save as InOut2
================
  Print YOUR name, address, and phone number on separate lines.



save as InOut3
================
  Ask the user for three decimal numbers, then print the information in
EXACTLY the form shown below. For instance, if you test with these numbers:
2.56318, 17.4, and 100 the output should be:

Your numbers were 2.5632, 17.4000, and 100.0000



save as InOut4
================
  Same as inout3 above, except print the numbers in the reverse order from
the way the user entered them. Testing with the same numbers as before,
the output should be:

Your numbers were 100.0000, 17.4000, and 2.5632



save as InOut5
================
  Ask the user for his first name, middle initial (a char), and his last name.
Then print the entire name in information in both forms shown below. So if the
user's first name is "Johnny", his last name is "Goode", and hiw middle initial
is "B" the output would be:

Name    : Johnny B. Goode
Name    : Goode, Johnny B.

Please notice that the user won't be entering the period after his/her
middle initial...
